# Hydrocarbon Combustion Balancer

# Overview
This Python script automatically balances the chemical equation for the combustion of hydrocarbons (alkanes) with oxygen. It calculates the stoichiometric coefficients for carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and oxygen (O2) based on the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon.

## Features

Balances the combustion reaction for hydrocarbons of the form CxHy.
Handles both whole number and fractional coefficients for oxygen.
Outputs the balanced chemical equation in a readable format.
Requirements
Python 3.x

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to create a scientific platform that teaches both science and coding. This script serves as an example of how programming can be applied to solve scientific problem.

# Usage
Run the script in a Python environment.
When prompted, enter the number of carbon atoms (C) in the hydrocarbon.
The script will output the balanced combustion reaction.
Example
If you enter 1 for the amount of coal (C), the output will be:
